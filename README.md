# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk by evaluating machine learning models as below:
- Naive Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling 
- Undersampling 
- Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Results:

#### Naive Random Oversampling

## Summary:

The models and the results shown above shows good risk in risk analysis. 
The Easy Ensemble models however is a lot more precise because the accuracy score is 92.54% which is the highest compared to the rest of the models.
